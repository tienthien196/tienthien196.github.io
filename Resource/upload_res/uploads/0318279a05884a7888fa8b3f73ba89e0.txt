[4581] A band of thieves rushes towards the port. One of them pushes you over. a blue bottle drops at your feet from his bag.
[4582] In a dark alley, a band of thieves shares a bag full of valuables.
[4583] A merchant offers you a bottle of blue water.
[4584] You get some coins and a blue flask.
[4585] You decide to visit Monkey Island. After hours in the jungle you get lost and face a portal.
[4586] The water in the flask reacts intensively and attracts you into the portal.
[4587] Monkeys drop bananas and a stone.
[4588] Fragments of the broken portal are strewn on the ground.
[4589] In a secret cave, you find an ancient portal. When you get close to it, you can feel that energy flows out of the gate.
[4590] A group of sleepy crabs surrounds the portal.
[4591] Surrounded by the sleeping crabs, you see something under a giant crab leg.
[4592] The water in the flask reacts intensively and attracts you to a breach.
[4593] You come to the portal, but nothing happens.
[4594] You wake up the giant crab.
[4595] You remember last words from a drunken pirate met at the Tavern. Spontaneously, you run about on the deck to flip your ship.
[4596] Your crew joins you and runs about on the deck to flip the ship.
[4597] You stop being confused and your soppy crew stares at you.
[4598] You are facing a portal made of ice, it looks fragile but you can still feel its power.
[4599] The portal collapses.
[4600] Nothing happens.
[4601] Before you leave, you pick up a piece of ice that appears to be linked to this portal.
[4602] The portal collapses.
[4603] Nothing happens.
[4604] You walk towards an illuminated temple. In front of the portal, there is an altar for offering.
[4605] You enter a place that seems to be a library. Books are floating all over.
[4606] You learn some knowledge of this lost civilization.
[4607] You learn some technology from this lost civilization.
[4608] This knowledge is useless.
[4609] In the dark sea, you see some faint lights in the distance.
[4610] The lights come from some lantern fishes.
[4611] There are some glowing jellyfishes.
[4612] You get some useful items from these creatures.
[4613] You get some useful items from these creatures.
[4614] You stop near giant fish bones.
[4615] A group of fish attacks you while you are resting.
[4616] You enjoyed a seafood meal.
[4617] A strange invention stands in the middle of a laboratory. It seems functional and an apparent note is on the table.
[4618] The cogs of the machine slowly activate. After few rotations the blue water in the middle shines. The machine stops brutally and suddenly creates a shock wave of energy.
[4619] You try to run the machine, but the cogs of the machine do not activate.
[4620] On the note, you recognize the symbol "Balance".
[4621] You try to run the machine, but the cogs of the machine do not activate.
[4622] There is still no response.
[4623] There is an anomaly and the space looks twisted.
[4624] From the book you read, you know that you can use this to strengthen your equipment.
[4625] This useless relic will do.
[4626] The power of time makes your weapons as sharp as brand new.
[4627] The power of time makes your weapons as sharp as brand new.
[4628] There is a workshop with some inventions you have never seen.
[4629] You've read that the stones on this worktable can duplicate anything.
[4630] This invention is very advanced and complex.
[4631] You don't have the knowledge to use any inventions but find a Strange Stone.
[4632] The machine changed one piece of your equipment.
[4633] The machine is broken.
[4634] You caught a colorful fish which you have never seen before.
[4635] It's quite delicious.
[4636] You have never tasted such a delicious fish.
[4637] The fish is poisonous.
[4638] There is a shaking small anomaly on a floating paper.
[4639] You cross the path of stuck entities.
[4640] The specters ask for help to break down the temporal anomaly that binds them here.
[4641] You don't understand their language. And they get sucked in by an anomaly.
[4642] They are thankful and leave.
[4643] The anomaly disappears.
[4644] You realize that you have been sailing around the same place for hours.
[4645] You sailed back to the starting place.
[4646] Your crew want to give up, frightened by the unnatural events that happens here.
[4647] Your crew seems boosted up.
[4648] You leave the weak and continue your expedition.
[4649] Half of your crew leave but others seem determined.
[4650] Some coins at the entrance of a small hole.
[4651] You squeeze through the hole and see more coins.
[4652] In the depths, aggressive creatures appear.
[4653] At the bottom of the hole, the heap of bones is mixed with some trinkets.
[4654] A floating locked chest.
[4655] You failed.
[4656] Madness takes hold of your crew.
[4657] Exhausted, your crew gradually regains its senses.
[4658] You enter an area with weird gravity. The ship is now upside down.
[4659] Everything back to normal.
[4660] The man that follows you from the eastern seas entrance seems to be performing his duty.
[4661] You repel the chaser and get some loot.
[4662] It looks the right direction.
[4663] It looks the right direction.
[4664] It looks the right direction.
[4665] You see the illusion of yourself in the fog.
[4666] It looks the right direction.
[4667] It looks the right direction.
[4668] Finally you get rid of the weird sea and your crew are very happy to escape from watching the same sea all the time.
[4669] It looks the right direction.
[4670] It looks the right direction.
[4671] It looks the right direction.
[4672] It looks the right direction.
[4673] You find some mechanical parts to repair your ship.
[4674] These mechanical parts are fallen from a mechanical Kraken. You awoke it.
[4675] You fall asleep.
[4676] Suddenly you wake up from the nightmare.
[4677] A fat merchant offers a deal to trade his precious treasure map for good and delicious valuables.
[4678] I need more.
[4679] Still not enough.
[4680] That's good enough. Take it.
[4681] As soon as you notice that the pirate sitting near you has the same treasure map as yours, he gets up, looks at you and leaves the tavern instantly.
[4682] You notice the pirate you saw previously sitting proudly on the treasure chest. "Too late, hahaha..."
[4683] "1, 2, 3..."
[4684] "But I can give you a second chance."
[4685] You lose.
[4686] You win. But the chest is empty. Only a message written on it: "Thank you for the food!"
[4687] A heavy silence surrounds you. You feel compelled to open the chest.
[4688] [missing]
[4689] This Maelstrom seems to be more powerful than any one you have encountered before.
[4690] Just before you leave the harbor. A man calls you to offer his services as a sailor aboard your ship.
[4691] You meet a new recruit. She is ready to join your crew in exchange of valuables.
[4692] She accepts and joins your crew.
[4693] A man settles at your table. Drunk, the man begins to embark on a monologue and explain that he was a famous captain feared by all. He challenges you to beat him.
[4694] The man, still drunk, joins your crew.
[4695] Your crew seems unhappy and a mutiny rise on your ship. It seems that the mutineers disagree with your tactical choices and cards you have picked.
[4696] It does not seem enough and they decide to challenge you to demote you.
[4697] The fratricide fight ends. The mutineers don't seem to regret their act. They salute your combativity before they vanish.
[4698] A location appears on your map. The glowing mark leads into a shipwreck in the depths of Skulls Island.
[4699] In a thick mist. The Cursed Book draws you into a huge shipwreck.
[4700] At the captain's room, a swarm of undead rushes towards you.
[4701] All undead seems defeated. An Undead Captain sit on a chair seems to hold something. You open his hand and discover a stone with a similar symbol as the Cursed Book.
[4702] The book reacts and a bright aura begins to emanate from the book.
[4703] Calm returns. With the Sacred Book in hand and the quest accomplished, you feel stronger.
[4704] In the center of the volcano, surrounded by lava, there is a blacksmith's anvil.
[4705] Each stroke echoes like a voice…
[4706] Each stroke echoes like a voice..."Weak"
[4707] Each stroke echoes like a voice..."Weak", "Weak"
[4708] Each stroke echoes like a voice..."Weak", "Weak", "Weak"
[4709] Overloaded and exhausted. The hot breath of the Beast surround you.
[4710] Leaving the volcano. Your energy restored, you feel stronger.
[4711] You hear some music far away and decide to follow it.
[4712] Touched by your song, the Band advise you to perform it against Coco at the Arena.
[4713] "Hola, Gringo! Listen to that song."
[4714] As a tribute for your talent. Coco gives you the legendary "Song of the Dead".
[4715] A group of pirates were attacked last night. They described the attackers as strangely dressed men.
[4716] A surprise boarded on your ship.
[4717] You repel the attack and the Overseas from Pirates Bay.
[4718] You see the merchant who has tricked you before. He recognizes you and leaves hurriedly.
[4719] You catch up with him.
[4720] The merchant looks panicked and seems ready to talk.
[4721] "Rumor says that a new champion brings chaos in the arena. This is a great opportunity for you to beat him and gain reputation."
[4722] Before the fight. You are surprised to see the champion seriously injured.
[4723] Lucy Weston looks lost and confused with a broken sword in her hand.
[4724] Finally, the one who brings chaos in the arena stands proudly before you. Ready to challenge you.
[4725] After an intense battle and without any words, the chicken seems to show you some respect and he leaves the silent arena.
[4726] Get some information from fisherman.
[4727] Defeated, the pirates denounce their captain.
[4728] You grab the captain's gun just before seeing his ship disappear into the depths of the sea.
[4729] You discover a cave with a heavy atmosphere.
[4730] It is a dead end.
[4731] You go deeper.
[4732] Attracted by the chest that stands in front of you, you withdraw your loot and place them all in it.
[4733] You take a look again at the dark chest.
[4734] The children's book seems more precious to you and you drop the other book.
[4735] This fight will be your last lesson.
[4736] This Burned Key belongs to you.
[4737] Vague memories come as you approach a burnt Manor. The place seems to be occupied by pirates.
[4738] The Manor seems to have been on fire in the past. The floor is unstable.
[4739] In the child's bedroom, you find a half-burnt chest.
[4740] A Medallion with a photo of an admiral and his daughter.
[4741] You don't have much time left before your body becomes a specter. Find a way to leave this place.
[4742] Arr... It's not working!
[4743] The energy from these stones is difficult to control.
[4744] Still not working!
[4745] "My curiosity will get me killed. I have no longer the right to make mistakes."
[4746] A beat emanates from the fused stone.
[4747] The unstable stone ignites.
[4748] The beat from the stone intensifies.
[4749] The flame becomes unstable.
[4750] You get the Philosopher's Stone which allows you to return from the dead.
[4751] Draw Tarot cards.
[4752] The Tower. Refers to a liberation and a great danger.
[4753] The Chariot. Refers to an hard-won victory over a giant sea monster.
[4754] It doesn't make sense.
[4755] It doesn't make sense.
[4756] It doesn't make sense.
[4757] The World. Refers to a voyage, an ending and a change.
[4758] You slowly approach a tentacle.
[4759] The Kraken is dead. The wounds left on the body were made by another Cursed Monster.
[4760] Convince the "Norths" villagers.
[4761] The villagers recognize your bravery and rally under your command.
[4762] Convince the "Settlers" villagers.
[4763] The villagers recognize your bravery and rally under your command.
[4764] The "Norths" and "Settlers" unite in the Northern Lands. Your troops seem worried.
[4765] "Highlanders… Ahoo, Ahoo!"
[4766] You rush to Coco. "Don't worry. I'm a doctor!"
[4767] "Oops sorry." Your healing skills didn't work well as you thought they would do.
[4768] Discretely, you cover remaining bones at your feet.
[4769] You rush towards a man who's holding his head under his arm. "Lucky for you, I know how to fix this."
[4770] You failed again. You bury the remains.
[4771] From failures you learn more.
[4772] You have been sailing here for a while. Your obsession leads you to the Gate.
[4773] Impossible to cross it. You find an engraved inscription on the gate. "Specter that desires to cross the gate must collect 7 souls."
[4774] Your determination leads you again to the Gate.
[4775] Your crew doesn't seem to have survived long without their captain. The mutineers now roam as the living dead.
[4776] You retrieve a sailor's log book. It describes "a crew caught by a spell and a curse"…
[4777] ...After few pages, you realize that the night of your abandonment is perceived as a last act of bravery of your crew in order to save you. Your determination to take revenge has never been stronger.
[4778] The source that massacred your crew is standing in front of you. This impressing Captain grabs a pirate and transforms him into an undead.
[4779] You are exhausted. The Undead Captain seems immortal. He throws you an icy look before disappearing into the fog.
[4780] The small flask lights up.
[4781] Marks and symbols light up as you pass.
[4782] A cave illuminated by symbols. At its center, well, pure water sparkle is in contact with the small flask and illuminates a passage.
[4783] You find yourself under water and… it is possible to breathe! You hardly have time to realize that creatures are attacking you.
[4784] You survive the attack but lose consciousness. You wake up on the shore with the loot you got from the battle.
[4785] You meet two navigators. They look strong and worth your challenge.
[4786] They are strong, you could join them, but feels like you disturb them.
[4787] You enter an abandoned ship and there is an Undead Captain holding a stone in his hand.
[4788] The crew connected by this stone seems to be a fragment of another story. The stone returned to its place. A sigh of relief seems to emanate from the Undead Captain.
[4789] The heavy gaze on you coming from these two scientists, it makes you uncomfortable.
[4790] Your thirst for combat and challenge seems to be incompatible with your boredom of science and knowledge.
[4791] You remember the strong man. He seems to be appeased by this woman and this young girl who accompany him.
[4792] This team seems already complete. No interest for you to join them.
[4793] "Buck-buck-buck-caw!"
[4794] The young man you fought earlier seems to understand you. Accompanied by a strange character, he challenges you again.
[4795] Awkward but polite, the Doctor approaches you and introduces himself "Hello, Mr. Chicken. Nice to meet you."
[4796] The power from the Doctor is powerful. A little intimidated, your quest for a crew ends here.
[4797] Tired. You decide to stop in order to drink at the Tavern. After several drinks, you begin to tell your story to the people around you.
[4798] "I remember the good old days... I crossed swords with the Masters of the seas. The fights were epic and we fought with honor..."
[4799] "After that time the world changed. A lot of thugs called themselves pirates and some values got lost. The decline in Pirates Bay began. The desire for easy money affected my own friends."
[4800] "My house was attacked. My daughter was... captured! After that day, I wasn't the same. The rage inside me took the control. Enraged, I slaughtered all the monsters standing in my way."
[4801] "Exhausted. I had lost all hope of seeing my daughter again. Lost and desperate I arrived where the dead live with the living and found an old friend."
[4802] "It took me a while to recognize my old friend. He approached me. And informed me that my daughter is still alive. She had not gone that far and has became a valiant fighter."
[4803] The whole tavern is silent. Many pirates stand around you eager to finally know the outcome of the story. But exhausted, you suddenly fall asleep with a smile, apparently appeased.
[4804] "Mmm... It didn't turn out like that... I think I drank too much! Let's start over."
[4805] You explore Monkey Island. After hours in the jungle you get lost and face a portal.
[4806] The portal activates briefly, a note with strange comes out with words written on it.
[4807] You explore Monkey Island. After hours in the jungle you get lost and face a portal.
[4808] The water in the flask intensifies and attracts you into the portal.
[4809] As you pass the portal, a specter in rush calls out to you: "I don't have much time to explain everything... the place that you will discover and attempt to sail for is in ruins and lost in time."
[4810] The specter is melancholic. "Long time ago, the city was magnificent and full of creative inventors. Technological progress was immediate. Our inventions and technology were so evolved that other states started to be mistrustful…"
[4811] The tone suddenly becomes heavier. "...The city decided to hide and disappear. Unfortunately, during the process, something went wrong and a wave of energy blew up the city. The city sank. Its citizens, the sea creatures, and also machines were all affected by it."
[4812] In a last breath, the desperate man ends his story. "I have no more time… Find and destroy the machine responsible of this chaos... Time is running out!" Then he disappears.
[4813] You are facing a strange machine. At its center, there's a giant bottle filled with brilliant blue water. Waves of pure energy emanate and push you back.
[4814] The machine slows down. The specter you have met appears. Determined, he walks towards the machine. You barely have time to realize what is going on that a huge wave of energy immediately blows through you.
[4815] Regaining its human form, the specter is revealing his true identity. "Greedy pirates. Your thirst to own the things of others is an obsession. I can finally be able to fix my mistake and protect my people."
[4816] "The days of pirates are over and a new era begins." Then, the mysterious man and the machine vanish.
[4817] You discover a statue of the man who is behind this chaos. And meet a specter family that seems to know him.
[4818] They tell you that the man who fooled you is a great man. He is also known as "the Great Architect" of Port Elysia.
[4819] You find a scientist book named "A New Era" written by "the Great Architect".
[4820] The book seems to be talking about energy stones and time theories. You can also read on its cover the quote "Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new."
[4821] A hand-writing note. "Would you be willing to sacrifice your soul to protect your family?"
[4822] The little paper ignites and returns to ashes.
[4823] You enter a sublime mansion. In the hall, the machine and the man you are looking for are standing in front of a family portrait. The blue water starts to whirl in the machine and the inventor turns to you.
[4824] "Your journey as a captain is over. I respect your determination, unfortunately it's too late."
[4825] The exhausted inventor falls to the ground. The man covered by blue water is in severe pain and implores you.
[4826] Time freezes. Debris and water slowly float around the hall to the machine. The unbreakable machine appears to be stepping back in time and recovering from the damage. Rebuilt, it looks different and a wave of pure energy pushes you out of the mansion.
[4827] In the Inventor's workshop, you read books about lost civilizations.
[4828] You learn more about a city named "Port Elysia" that lived on another sea across portals.
[4829] After hours, you decrypt the message and learn that portals are connected to strange blue water's energy.
[4830] Portals to "Port Elysia" will react and open if you possess a Shiny Pure Water.
[4831] You pick the door lock of a workshop. Your research leads to forbidden rituals and soul manipulation. You discover the existence of a cursed clan of monkeys which could be your origin.
[4832] At Monkey Island, you discover stones with ancestral languages and strange symbols used for rituals.
[4833] Your scar is burning when you approach two paths.
[4834] Standing in front of a ritual altar, memories come to you. You barely have time to see a lifeless monkey puppet with similar scar on its chest, the cursed clan of monkeys lurking in the shadows leaps over your way.
[4835] To not forget where you came from and who you are, you pick up a relic and leave the place.
[4836] "All hands hoay, captain and his Banana Gang ship in sight!"\nBanana Gang is a ferocious gang of monkeys that control the banana black market in Pirates Bay and Monkey Island.
[4837] You are about to approach a ship and its crew.
[4838] Victory! The bounty is yours.
[4839] "All hands hoay, captain and his Cursed Book ship in sight!"\nSome explorers claim to have seen the silhouette of the cursed ship wandering the misty seas of Skulls Island.
[4840] "All hands hoay, captain and his Winglanders Clan ship in sight!"\nThe Winglanders are fearless fighters. Unfortunately, their wings make them the worst navigator.
[4841] "All hands hoay, captain and his Soul Whisperers ship in sight!"\nFestive and spiritual crew has made a name for itself through a hypnotizing mastery of fire.
[4842] "All hands hoay, captain and his Gold Rushers ship in sight!"\nCollectors fascinated by gold. They dug too deep and woke up the Volcano.
[4843] "All hands hoay, captain and his Elysians Crew ship in sight!"\nAn Elysian ship, rescued from disaster by a portal guardian, still sails the sky of Pirate Bay.
[4844] "All hands hoay, captain and his Band of Chaos ship in sight!"\nThis crew has won favor of the Kraken with its cursed and forbidden music.
[4845] "All hands hoay, captain and his Devil Captain ship in sight!"\nThis captain and minions sail from island to island, to collect his booty from indebted pirates.
[4846] "All hands hoay, captain and his Lost Travelers ship in sight!"\nMaintained by the master of time, fragments of the past still linger in certain forgotten objects.
